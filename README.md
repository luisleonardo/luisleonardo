## Just a Random Bio from a Random Cybersecurity Guy ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŒŸ about_me
I'm both an enthusiast and a professional in cybersecurity and infosec, with a unique passion for hardware hacking (SDR, BadUSB, Wi-Fi Jamming/Deauth, etc). At this point, I can no longer distinguish between my profession and my hobby â€” they've become one and the same.

## âš¡fun_facts
My perfect night? A glass of wine and a good incident post-mortem.
I am also always up for a solid OSINT challenge or a frantic CTF.
